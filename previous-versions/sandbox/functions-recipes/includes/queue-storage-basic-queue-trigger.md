## Triggering via Azure Storage Queue
Storage Queues can be used as triggers for your functions.

Using the `QueueTrigger` attribute, you can supply the queue along with the connection information for the storage account that should be used.


```csharp
 [FunctionName("FunctionsQueueTrigger")]
 public static void Run([QueueTrigger("101functionsqueue", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]string myQueueItem,
     TraceWriter log)
 {
     log.Info($"C# Queue trigger function processed: {myQueueItem}");
 }

```
