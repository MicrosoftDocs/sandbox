## Azure Storage Queue output binding
Azure Storage Queues can be used as output bindings for your Azure Functions app. Using the `Queue` attribute allows you to make a parameter as a source to push queue messages. Some supported parameter types include:

* out <POCO> -  a .NET POCO is serialized into JSON before being added to the message payload
* out string
* out byte[]


```csharp
[FunctionName("BasicQueueOutput")]
public static void Run([TimerTrigger("*/30 * * * * *")]TimerInfo myTimer,
                       TraceWriter log,
                       [Queue("101functionsqueue",Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")] out string queueMessage)
{
    log.Info("101 Azure Function Demo - Storage Queue output");

    queueMessage = DateTime.UtcNow.ToString();
}
```

* Use the `Queue` attribute.
* The `Queue` attribute requires the name of the queue and the name of the setting that holds the connection information for your storage account.
* If POCOs, strings, and byte arrays are parameters of your function, they must be marked with the `out` keyword.
