## GitHub Comment Webhook

Functions can be triggered with a GitHub webhook. This requires configuring a webhook for a GitHub repository. This example logs issue comments from a GitHub repository.

```csharp
using System.Net;

public static async Task Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
{
    dynamic data = await req.Content.ReadAsAsync<object>();
    string gitHubComment = data?.comment?.body;
    log.Info("GitHub Comment WebHook: " + gitHubComment);
}

```
