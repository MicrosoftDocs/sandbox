> [!NOTE]
> Visual Studio App Center supports end to end and integrated services central to mobile app development. Developers can use **Build**, **Test** and **Distribute** services to set up Continuous Integration and Delivery pipeline. Once the app is deployed, developers can monitor the status and usage of their app using the **Analytics** and **Diagnostics** services, and engage with users using the **Push** service. Developers can also leverage **Auth** to authenticate their users and **Data** service to persist and sync app data in the cloud.

# Azure Mobile Apps SDK for Unity

[!include[](../../includes/header.md)]

## Azure Mobile Apps for Gaming

[Azure Mobile Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-mobile/) contains a variety of features for building cross-platform mobile titles.  This SDK currently supports working with Easy Tables.  [Easy Tables](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-dotnet-how-to-use-client-library) are a great way to read, write, and query data in a simple table format.  While more features exist in the service, they are not yet supported by this SDK, but will be evaluated for future releases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an experimental Unity SDK for Azure Mobile Apps.  As such, please note that this SDK is not supported and is not provided by the Azure Mobile Apps team.  If you run into problems, please let us know using the [GitHub Issues](https://aka.ms/azsdks-unity-issues) page for the SDK.

[![Try it now](../../media/buttons/try2.png)](https://aka.ms/azmobile-unitysdk)

## Requirements

* [Unity 2018.1, .2, or .3](https://unity3d.com/)
  * Unity 2018.2 (or greater) is required for proper SSL support.
  * If you are using Unity 2017, please check out our [Unity 2017 SDK](./azure-mobile-apps-unity-2017.md).
  * Unity 2019.x and greater are not supported and will not work with these SDKs.
* [An Azure Mobile Apps account (Sign up for free!)](https://aka.ms/azfreegamedev)

## Compatibility

This has been tested with the following Unity exporters.  Others wil likely work, however we haven't tested every possible platform and combination.  Please let us know if you've had success!

* Windows/Mac Standalone
* iOS
* Android
* UWP (IL2CPP)
* Unity Editor

## Import the SDK

To import the SDK into your own project, make sure you have downloaded the latest [.unitypackage](https://aka.ms/azmobile-unitysdk) from GitHub.  Then, do the following:

[!include[](include/unity-import.md)]

Please refer to the [Azure Mobile Apps Docs](https://aka.ms/azgamedev) for even more samples and tutorials on using the API.

## Unity 2018.1 and SSL support

Due to a Unity 2018.1 limitation (fixed in 2018.2), HTTPS requests using the standard .NET networking stack (i.e. not using UnityWebRequest) will fail.  To workaround this, you will need to use the **http** version of the Mobile Apps endpoint instead of **https**.  **This means your data will not be encrypted to and from the server.**  Here's an example: `http://mymobileapp.azurewebsites.net/`.   We highly recommend upgrading your project to Unity 2018.2 if possible.

## Try the Sample

To use the sample, you will need to have an Azure Mobile Apps account setup along with a valid connection string.  You can learn more about that [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/MobileApps/common/MobileApps-create-MobileApps-account).

To use the sample, do the following:

1. Download the [Unity SDKs repo](https://aka.ms/azsdks-unity) from GitHub (or import it from the .unitypackage and continue to step 4).

1. Unzip to a location on your hard drive.

1. Open Unity 2018.1 (or greater) and point it to the **MobileApps** directory inside the unzipped package.

1. In the **Project** window, double-click the **AzureMobileApps** scene inside the **Assets\AzureSamples\MobileApps** directory to open the main scene for the sample.

1. In this scene, select the **MobileAppsObject** item in the **Hierarchy** window.

1. With **MobileAppsObject** selected, you'll notice that there is a blank entry named **Mobile App Uri** in the **Inspector** window.  Fill in this entry with the valid URI as shown on the Azure portal, but remember to change the endpoint to use **http** as described above.  The URI will be **http://&lt;yourAppName&gt;.azurewebsites.net/**.

1. Run the project from within the editor by clicking the **Play** button.  Alternatively, you can export to the platform of your choosing and run there.

1. At this point, you can click the button for any of the four Mobile Apps types and watch the output window.  If things are setup and working, you will see the sample test a standard workflow.

The code for the sample is broken out into four separate scripts, one for each Mobile Apps type.  Take a look at each to learn more about how it works.
