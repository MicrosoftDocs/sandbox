# Azure Gaming Samples

There are many samples that demonstrate a variety of gaming scenarios using Azure.  We have collected some of these samples below.

## Scavenger

[![Get the source](../media/buttons/source2.png)](https://aka.ms/scavenger)

Scavenger is a virutal scavenger hunt game written in Unity.  Each day players are presented with a list of items to take a photo of.  If the Computer Vision API determines the photo contains the required object, a point is awarded. The game demonstrates usage of various Azure services:

* [Cognitive Services](https://aka.ms/cogdocs-scavenger)
* [Azure Functions](https://aka.ms/afdocs-scavenger)
* [Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/cosdocs-scavenger)
* [PlayFab](https://playfab.com/)

For more information, check out the linked GitHub repo, and watch the [session recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arikdfd8_A8) from Build.

## Multiplayer Scaling with Azure Container Instances

This project allows you to manage Docker containers running on [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/).
Suppose that you want to manage a series of running Docker containers. These containers may be stateful, so classic scaling methods (via Load Balancers etc.) would not work. A classic example is multiplayer game servers, where its server has its own connections to game clients, its own state etc. Another example would be batch-style projects, where each instance would have to deal with a separate set of data. For these kind of purposes, you would need a set of Docker containers being created on demand and deleted when their job is done and they are no longer needed in order to save costs.

## Multiplayer Scaling with Kubernetes

Scaling dedicated game servers is hard. They're stateful, can't (well, shouldn't) be explicitly shut down (since players might be still enjoying their game) and, as a rule of thumb, their connection with the players must be of minimal latency, especially for real-time games.  This sample aims to provide a solution/guidance for managing containerized dedicated game servers on Azure Platform using the managed [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/).

## Leaderboards with Azure Functions, Node, and Cosmos DB

[![Get the source](../media/buttons/source2.png)](https://aka.ms/azleaderboardsample)

This project is a starter kit that allows you to set up a RESTful API service that stores game leaderboards (scores) and exposes them via HTTP(s) methods/operations. A game developer can use this API service in their game and post new scores, get the top scores, find out the latest ones and more. Additionally, a Unity sample client is included in the project.

The technology/architecture stack includes an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app hosted on an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions/) that talks to a [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) database via its [MongoDB API]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction)). [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/) service is used to provide information and metrics regarding application performance and behavior. A Unity game engine client is also provided, with a relevant Unity C# SDK to access the leaderboards API.

You can check the source code and the relevant documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AzureFunctionsNodeLeaderboards-Cosmos) and read the relevant blog post [here](https://dgkanatsios.com/2018/01/12/using-azure-functions-and-cosmos-db-to-create-a-game-leaderboard/).

## Analytics with Event Hubs, Azure Functions, Cosmos DB, and Datalake

[![Get the source](../media/buttons/source2.png)](https://aka.ms/azanalyticssample)

A simple architecture to consume and process messages coming from video game clients (or servers) using the following Azure services:

* [Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/)
* [Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/)
* [Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/cosdocs-scavenger)
* [Data Lake Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/)
* [Data Lake Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-analytics/)
