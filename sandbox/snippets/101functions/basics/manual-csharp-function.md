## Manual C# Function

The following example is a function that must be triggered manually. The Azure portal is one way to trigger a function manually.

```csharp
using System;

public static void Run(string input, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info($"This is a manually triggered C# function with input: {input}");
}
```
