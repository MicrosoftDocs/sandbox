## AzureFunctionsNodeLeaderboards-Cosmos

[![Get the source](../media/buttons/source2.png)](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AzureFunctionsNodeLeaderboards-Cosmos)

This project is a starter kit that allows you to set up a RESTful API service that stores game leaderboards (scores) and exposes them via HTTP(s) methods/operations. A game developer can use this API service in their game and post new scores, get the top scores, find out the latest ones and more. Additionally, a Unity sample client is included in the project. 

The technology/architecture stack includes an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) app hosted on an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) that talks to a [Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/) database via its [MongoDB API]((https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb-introduction)). [Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/) service is used to provide information and metrics regarding application performance and behavior. A Unity game engine client is also provided, with a relevant Unity C# SDK to access the leaderboards API.

You can check the source code and the relevant documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/AzureFunctionsNodeLeaderboards-Cosmos) and read the relevant blog post [here](https://dgkanatsios.com/2018/01/12/using-azure-functions-and-cosmos-db-to-create-a-game-leaderboard/).
