# Using the Azure Storage SDK with MonoGame

[!include[](../../includes/header.md)]

[![Get the source](../../media/buttons/source2.png)](https://github.com/BrianPeek/AzureSamples-MonoGame)
<!--[![Try it now](../../media/buttons/try2.png)](https://github.com/BrianPeek/AzureSamples-MonoGame)-->

## Requirements

* [MonoGame 3.6 or higher (earlier versions may work)](http://www.monogame.net/)
* [An Azure Storage account (Sign up for free!)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## Compatibility

This has been tested with the following projects.  Others may work, so please let us know if you've had success!

* Windows
* UWP
* iOS
* Android

## Known Issues and Limitations

* None

## How to Use It

Because MonoGame uses the traditional .NET Framework and CLR on Windows, and Xamarin on other platforms, the existing Azure Storage SDK NuGet package works as-is across all platforms.  To use the Azure Storage SDK, simply add a NuGet package reference to the **WindowsAzure.Storage** package.

1. Click the **Projects > Manage NuGet Packages** menu.

1. In the NuGet Package Manager window, enter **azure storage** in the search box.  The **WindowsAzure.Storage** package will appear.

1. Highlight this package, then click the **Install** button on the right side of the window.

1. Accept any license prompts, and the package will be installed.

With the package added, you can now use the Azure Storage SDK API in your MonoGame game as you would in any other .NET application.  The **Get the Source** button above will link you to a cross-platform MonoGame sample showing how to use the basic features of the Azure Storage SDK.  Also, please refer to the [Azure Storage Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) for even more samples and tutorials.

## Try the Sample

To use the sample, you will need to have an Azure Storage account setup along with a valid connection string.  You can learn more about that [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account).

To use the sample, do the following:

1. Download the [MonoGame samples](https://github.com/BrianPeek/AzureSamples-MonoGame) from GitHub.

1. Unzip to a location on your hard drive.

1. Navigate to that location and open the **AzureStorage.sln** solution file in the **Storage** directory.

1. Open **Game1.cs** from the **AzureStorage.Shared** project in Solution Explorer.

1. Look for the **ConnectionString** member and replace with your valid connection string.  You can find your connection strings in the Azure Portal as shown.

1. Build and run!  Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 on your keyboard to test the associated storage API.
