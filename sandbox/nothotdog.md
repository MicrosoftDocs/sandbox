# NotHotdog
If you're familiar with [HBO's Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley), you'll understand the reference for this project.  If not, it'll seem very random.  Either way, it's still very stupid.  [NotHotdog](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdogFunc) is an Azure Function that uses the [Computer Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) in [Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/) to determine if a provided image contains a hotdog or not.  

[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBrianPeek%2FNotHotdogFunc%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json)

> [!TIP]
> If you'd like to train your own model to recognize images for your domain, check out the [NotBacon](/sandbox/notbacon) article.

## Requirements
* An [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) account
* To build and test locally, [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.com) version 15.3 or higher

## Links
* [NotHotdogFunc Repo](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdogFunc)

## What's It Do?
Give the Azure Function a URL to an image, or POST the image data, and it will return a JSON payload stating whether the picture is a hotdog or not.

## Configuration
There are two parts to settings this up to try out:

### Computer Vision API
To use the [Computer Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/), you will need an endpoint and key.

1. Browse to the [Cognitive Services API portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/), logging in if necessary.
1. Click the **Get API Key** button in the **Computer Vision API** section.
   ![get api key](media/nothotdog/get-api-key.png)
1. You will be given an endpoint and 2 keys.  Copy these to a safe place, but note that you can always review your information later at [https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/).
   ![api key](media/nothotdog/api-key.png)

If you have already used up your trial for the Computer Vision API, you can register for a production key using [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account).

### Azure Deployment
1. Click the [Deploy to Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FBrianPeek%2FNotHotdogFunc%2Fmaster%2Fazuredeploy.json) link here or the button above.
1. Enter the information for your Azure subscription, such as the resource group, unique App Name, etc.  This App Name will become part of the URL.  You'll also need the Computer Vision API key and URL from the previous step.
   ![azure deploy](media/nothotdog/azure-deploy.png)

The function application will be deployed and the GitHub repo above will be setup as the deployment source.  Additionally, the key and endpoint you entered will be automatically configured.  Copy down the URL to your function, which will be **https://&lt;appname&gt;.azurewebsites.net** , with the Function endpoint being **https://&lt;appname&gt;.azurewebsites.net/api/NotHotdog** .

### Running Locally
You can clone the [repo](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdogFunc) and run the project locally.  This requires Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 or higher, with the Azure Development workload installed.  For more information, see [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs).  Note that if you opt to run locally, you will need to create a **local.settings.json** file in the same directory as the function with your endpoint and API keys.  Here's an example -- simply fill in the **VisionKey** and **VisionUri** with the values given to you by the service, and leave the rest blank.

```json
{
	"IsEncrypted": false,
	"Values": {
		"AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
		"AzureWebJobsDashboard": "",
		"VisionKey": "<your API key>",
		"VisionUri": "https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0"
	}
}
```

## How to Run
The Azure Function is now configured and running, and will be available at https://&lt;sitename&gt;.azurewebsites.net/api/NotHotdogFunc .  As an example, let's use [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) to hit the endpoint in both ways:

### Link to image
```
curl http://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/api/NotHotdog?url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Hot_dog_on_a_plate_-_Evan_Swigart.jpg
```

```json
"{\"isHotdog\":\"true\"}"
```

### POST image data
```
curl --data-binary "@not-a-hotdog.jpg" http://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/api/NotHotdog
```

```json
"{\"isHotdog\":\"false\"}"
```

Of course, you could call this from a web-based back-end, a mobile app, or anything else.  Simply hit the endpoint in either way and parse the JSON response.

## How it Works
This Azure Function was created with the new Visual Studio 2017 Tools for Azure Functions included with the 15.3 update.  To create a new Function, ensure the Azure Development workload is installed and then create a new Azure Functions project:

![new project](media/nothotdog/new-project.png)

After the project is created, right-click on the project and select **Add > New Item...** from the context menu, then select **Azure Function** from the window that pops up, giving it a new name.

![new item](media/nothotdog/new-item.png)

Finally, select the [trigger](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-triggers-bindings) action, in this case **Http trigger**, and select the authorization type.

![new function](media/nothotdog/new-function.png)

For more details on these tools, please see the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs).

Additionally, a NuGet reference was set to the [Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Vision](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Vision/) package, which contains the API to call the Computer Vision API from .NET.

The steps above have already done in the [sample project](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdogFunc), and a function named **NotHotdog** was created.  The code for the function is only a few lines.  Here's a very condensed version (see the [source code](https://github.com/BrianPeek/NotHotdogFunc/blob/master/NotHotdog.cs) for the full version).

```csharp
[FunctionName("NotHotdog")]
public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run([HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", "post", Route = null)]HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
{
	// grab the key and URI from the portal config
	string visionKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("VisionKey");
	string visionUri = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("VisionUri");

	// create a client and request Tags for the image submitted
	VisionServiceClient vsc = new VisionServiceClient(visionKey, visionUri);
	VisualFeature[] vf = { VisualFeature.Tags };
	AnalysisResult result = null;

	// get the image data POST'ed to us
	Stream stream = await req.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();

	// ask Computer Vision API to analyze it
	result = await vsc.AnalyzeImageAsync(stream, vf);

	// check if a "hotdog" tag is returned
	if(result.Tags.Select(tag => tag.Name.ToLowerInvariant()).Contains("hotdog"))
		return GetResponse(req, true);
}
```
