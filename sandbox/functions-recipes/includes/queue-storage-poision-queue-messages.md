## Poison queue messages with Azure Storage Queue Triggers
If a function triggered by a `QueueTrigger` fails, the Azure Functions runtime automatically retries that function five times for that specific queue message.
If the message continues to fail, then the bad message is moved to a "poison" queue. The name of the queue will be based on the original + "-poison".

For example, a storage queue named `myqueue` results in a poison queue named `myqueue-poison`.


```csharp
[FunctionName("PoisionQueues")]
public static void Run([QueueTrigger("101functionsqueue", Connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage")]CloudQueueMessage myQueueItem, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info("101 Azure Function Demo - Poision Queue Messages");

    log.Info($"Queue ID: {myQueueItem.Id}");
    log.Info($"Queue Dequeue Count: {myQueueItem.DequeueCount}");
    log.Info($"Queue Payload: {myQueueItem.AsString}");

    throw new Exception("Intentional failure");
}
```

After letting the code above run, there should be a queue names `101functionsqueue-poison` with the message that failed to process.

* Using `CloudQueueMessage`, metadata such as the message dequeue count can be retrieved.
* Five attempts are made to process a queue message before moving it to a poison queue.
